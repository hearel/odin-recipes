    <h1>KITFO</h1>

    <h2>KITFO (Ethiopian Traditional Food)</h2>
        <p>Kitfo, Ethiopian Cuisine consists of minced raw beef, marinated in mitmita (a chili powder-based spice blend) and niter kibbeh (a clarified butter infused with herbs and spices).</p>
        <p>Kitfo cooked lightly rare is known as kitfo leb leb. Kitfo is often served alongside-sometimes mixed with- a mild cheese called ayibe or cooked greens known as gomen. In many parts of Ethiopia, kitfo is served with injera, a flatbread made from teff, although in traditional Gurage cuisine, one would use kocho, a thick flatbread made from the ensete plant. An ensete leaf may be used as a garnish. Though not considered a delicacy, kitfo is generally held in high regard.</p>

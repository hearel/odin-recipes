    <h2>doro wet (Ethiopian Traditional Food)</h2>
        <p>Doro wat (Amharic - ዶሮ ወጥ), also called tsebhi derhō (ጸብሒ ደርሆ) in Tigrinya, is a slow-cooked chicken stew, cooked in a sauce made with caramelized onions, berbere, and spiced butter (niter kibbeh).  As with all stews, there are plenty of variations out there - with or without tomato paste, varying the spices, etc.  Regardless, it's always good.</p>
        <p>Doro wat is a richly spiced, fragrant, and delicious chicken-and-egg stew from Ethiopia and Eritrea.  The chicken cooks in a flavour-rich base of slow-cooked onions, berbere, niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter), ginger, and garlic. Hard-boiled eggs go in towards the end for a protein-rich and delightfully low-cost meal fit to feed a small army.</p>
